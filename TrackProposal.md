4) Implement an encoder-decoder neural network architecture  
- Use existing DC content:
  - First 3 lessons of Intro to NLP course
  - 1 lesson - Implement an encoder-decoder neural network architecture using Keras

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Language Modeling in Python (EXISTING DC COURSE)  
- (Justification: I'm aware that most current LLMs are based on Transformers rather than RNNs, but this course has useful foundational studides in language models and sequencet-to-sequence models that we can draw on later.)  
  
Transformers  
- Marketing Description:  
  - Transformers are literally revolutionizing deep learning and AI today! Learn from our industry experts how to use Tensorflow and Keras to implement the transformer architectures that in the last few years have paved the way for the breakthroughs in AI chatbots and text-to-image generation.  
- Learning Objectives:  
1) Describe the functions of each key component of the transformer architecture  
2) Implement a transformer architecture with Tensorflow and Keras  
3) Train and test a transformer sequence-to-sequence model  
  
AI Chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Marketing Description:  
  - ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing are breakthrough AI technologies based on Large Language Models (LLMs), and our expert instructors will guide you in this course to understand what they do and how they do it! You'll begin with chatbot fundamentals and end up with the cutting-edge skills to build Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models.  
- Learning Objectives:  
1) Create a model for receiving text, parsing text, and providing responses in a chatbot  
2) Identify useful applications of AI chatbots  
3) Implement a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for a chatbot  
4) Describe how AI chatbots are built and trained with large language models  
- Use existing DC content:  
  - First lesson of Building Chatbots in Python course  
  - First lesson of Intro to ChatGPT course  
  
Text-to-Image Models  
- Marketing Description:  
  - Learn from our expert instructors in this course what's going on under the hood in the incredible text-to-image models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion! Build on your Deep Learning skills with Tensorflow and Keras to create the GAN and transformer architectures that enable machines to generate fantastic, realistic images on demand.  
- Learning Objectives:  
1) Create a GAN architecture for a text-to-image model  
2) Implement a transformer architecture for a text-to-image model  
3) Evaluate and fine-tune models to improve performance  
  
Ethical Considerations around Generative AI  
- Marketing Description:  
  - While products like ChatGPT and DALL-E have been revolutionizing what AI can do, there is great concern about its potential negative impacts on society. Why did over 1000 scientists, including many who are involved in the work, share a letter with the world community in March 2023 calling for a moratorium on further development of these AI technologies? In this course, you'll dive into understanding the potential biases and risks of generative AI technologies, as well as identifying positive ways forward for this research.  
- Learning Objectives:  
1) Identify potential biases associated with generative AI models  
2) Identify potential risks of societal impacts around development and deployment of these models  
3) Iedntify potential next steps to mitigate and address these potential biases and risks
